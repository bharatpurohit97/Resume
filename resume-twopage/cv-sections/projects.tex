  {July. 2018 - Sept. 2018}
  {
    \begin{cvitems}
    \item Developed a tool in Scala to parse, analyze and classify  programs from large programming courses, to help provide
      suggestions and tips to weak students.
    \item Reduced C programs to a linear high level representation. Used it to find similar features between programs, thus allowing discovering corrections in a program using reference programs.
    \item Classified programs to provide suggestions to students based on programs similar to their submission.
